## Project Summary

# Selected Scraper: Beautiful Soup
The reason I selected this scraper over the other one is because I was more familar with it since I had to use it for another assignment in another one of my classes. It is easy to set up which is helpful when needed to use it for this assignment. 
## The steps I took:
  -First getting familiar with the list of Falcon 9 tables 
  -Next fully understanding the assignment and what my goal was when completing it 
  -I used requests and beautiful soup to scrape the data
  -Then I started coding and extracting the fields needed for each of the 8 program reports
  -I had to parse the data with every part of the columns to get the information
  -After that I just had to meet the conditions for each of the programs to find and print the specific instructions
## The total time 
  - For me to complete this part of the assignment iy was a couple days since I spread it however, it didn't take long to use beautiful soup and after understanding it, it became easier to use
